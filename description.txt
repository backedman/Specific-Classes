Restrict yourself to a single damage type! Makes all the other damage types weaker.
ex. If you pick melee, melee damage will remain normal, but everything else only does 0.5x the damage.
This allows you to restrict yourself to one class, while still being able to use weapons from others for things like mobility or major benefits at a VERY reduced rate.
